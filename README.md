# instacart-basket-analysis

Note: Instacart is a real company that has made its data available online. However, the data used in this project has been fabricated for educational purposes as part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics program. 

Instacart wishes to develop targeted marketing strategies for different segments of their customer base. To achieve this, they must first find ways to better segment their customer base into target groups. This project aims to provide useful insights to inform this segmentation by analysing a selection of Instacart's customer, order and product data.
The analysis conducted in the project also aims to answer the following key questions:

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.

● The marketing and sales team are also interested in how certain customer traits, such as 
brand loyalty, region, age and family status, can affect a customer's order habits.
